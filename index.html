	<p>Freshly brewed front-end web developer with an unrepentant love of caffeine.</p>

	<p>Steeped in a liberal arts education from UNC Chapel Hill, I have eight years of experience as an analyst conducting due diligence investigations and identifying potential risk, with specialization on high profile individuals and companies in the finance industry.  I write adeptly for professional audiences and organize high volumes of complex information for presentation.  I am passionate about building and strengthening relationships through communication that fosters cohesive teamwork, understanding, and empowerment.</p>

	<p>But that's the boring stuff, right? When not coding, I'm finding other ways to create. Favorites include: embroidering, sketching, and writing plot lines and mechanics for table top games.</p>
